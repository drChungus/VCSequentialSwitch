A sequential switch is a device to route your signals to different places. The routing can be controlled with a clock signal or a button on the front panel. A reset input is also available to set the switch to its initial routing. This module combines two switches in a small footprint. The signal paths of the two switches are independent, but their state will always be the same. They can be advanced and reset with the same clock signal resulting in a coupled behavior. 
As both switches are always on the same stage this module is ideal to route dual signals, like stereo audio, CV/Gate pairs, and in general vary two independent signals at the same time. Inputs and outputs for the signal path can be switched up!
